*Part 1*

Here are a few of the maps created from the GeoDa instructions

*Part 2* 

The Following maps and graph were created using the Baltimore community Vital Signs dataset, and use a simple univariate analysis on the sales numbers for each neighborhood. In retrospect, it would have been more interesting  to use data from multiple years, to see how the communities changed over time, as one year isn't particularly interesting.

*Part 3*

For this section I used Bigfoot and Dogman sighting data that I found online here: https://data.world/timothyrenner

I ran a few simple types of analsis that are listed above each map. I found the point data online, and used the count "count points in polygon" tool in QGIS to find the number of BigFoot and Dogman sightings in each congressional district. From there, the data was ready to be used. 

Here is a univariate regression on Bigfoot sightings within the United States

Here is a significance map of Bigfoot sightings

Here is a Moran's scatterplot of the Bigfoot regression data.

Below is a percentile map of Bigfoot sightings in the United States.

As an added bonus, here is a Co-Location map of both DogMan and Bigfoot sightings. I had never heard of Dogman before this excercise, but I obviously couldn't pass up an opportunity to use the data provided to me. Could they be in league?
